This repository (master branch) contains a description of microbiome data analysis for the effect of DNA extraction protocol on Biological Oxygen-dosed Activataed Carbon biofilm communities.<br>
Many studies investigating Biological Activated Carbon (BAC) microbial communities by means of 16S rRNA gene analysis have been published in recent years, but none of them has assessed how the choice of initial samples and the DNA extraction protocol can affect DNA yields and quality, as well as the resulting microbial community profiles. In this study, two DNA extraction protocols based on Cetryltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and the FastDNAâ„¢ SPIN kit for Soil were used to extract DNA from both whole granules and detached biofilms sampled from full-scale biological activated carbon filters. Successful DNA extraction and comparable microbial community profiles were obtained after the application of the two protocols, but the DNA extracted with the FastDNA-based protocol had uniformly better DNA quality and slightly higher DNA concentration after purification compared to DNA extracted with the CTAB-based protocol. Microbial community profiles resulting from the whole granule samples significantly differed from the ones of detached biofilms. Thus, whole BAC granules are recommended for DNA extraction to ensure representative results.
